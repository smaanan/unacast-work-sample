# Unacast Work Sample Data Scientist 2022

This repository contains the code and the supporting data files for recreating the answers I provided for the Unacast Work Sample Data Scientist 2022, which was about extracting insights from the NYC Citibike data set found [here](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-new-york/nyc-citi-bike?filter=solution-type:dataset&q=citi&id=fcfc44d2-8502-4d73-ac4d-10030a80e48b).

Besides the database in the link above, I also used the NYC weather data from January 01 2017 to December 31 2018, which I downloaded from the National Climate Data Center, and the shapefile of NYC downloaded from the NYC Planning. Both data sets are attached above.
